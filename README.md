# Project Shift Coding Challenge

Below are 6 coding problems, each worth several points. In total, 20 points are available and you must get 14 in order to "pass". But not to worry! If you do not pass the first time, you will be able to attempt the challenge again.

Please read each prompt carefully and follow the directions. When you're finished you'll submit you work through a form and your work will then be immediately and automatically graded. If you submit your work incorrectly, it could lead to misleading, failing results.

It is recommended that you use the `submissions-template.js` file as a starting point.


## Problem 1
Write a function called `findSum` that takes an array of numbers as an argument and finds the average of that array of numbers and returns that average as a number.
For example:

```js
findSum([2, 4, 6]); // 12
```
